## Problem:
DynamicSystems&trade; finally announced version 2 of the CoolCPU, and updated their website for it: [problems.hackdalton.com:28616](http://problems.hackdalton.com:28616)

You've also heard from a friend that this time the...interesting data...is now on the new hard drive of the online CoolCPU simulator. More specifically, it takes up exactly one sector of the hard drive.
