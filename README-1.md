## Problem:
You've been hearing about the exciting new DynamicSystems&trade; CoolCPU, which they finally announced on their website: [problems.hackdalton.com:45414](http://problems.hackdalton.com:45414)

You've also heard from a friend that there's some...interesting data...on the online CoolCPU simulator. More specifically, a string of characters at memory address `0x93`, ending with a `0x00` character.
